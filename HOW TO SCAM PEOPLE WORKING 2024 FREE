How to steal money on tinder or on any dating website:
(Written by IC3 on discord. DMCA protected, editing this message will result in a DMCA TAKEDOWN request.)



Step 1:

Make a account. If you already have one, then skip this step.
Name the account something that will get a mans attention. (Hot mama, Local woman ready to mingle, etc.)


Step 2:

Once you made your account, find someone that needs a "Girl".
When you find a guy, swipe right on his profile. (Wait for him to match with you)


Step 3:

After he accepted your "match", start a conversation with him. Keep it natural, DO NOT USE AI. Try to
keep his attention towards YOU.


Step 4: (A bit longer)

Once you sparked up a conversation with the guy, ask if you can come to his place. But say your in like Romania or Russia. (Some random Slavic country). You will say that you have 500$ saved up, but you need 600 - 700 more dollars to come. Once he sends it, find a picture online of you inside a Russian (Or random Slavic airport) airport. 


Step 5:

Once you sent him the pictures, say to him that Airport security wont let you through because they think that your staying in America to work. And pretend you miss your flight. Then ask him for 1,500$ to get the next one. (Remember to ask him to transfer the money through paypal, then friends and family to make it harder for him to refund the money)


Step 6:

When he sends the money, transfer it to a separate account as quickly as you possibly can. You then delete your tinder profile, block him on everything. 


Step 7:

Once you transferred the money, he can't do anything about it. Because his money is in a entirely different app.


Step 8:

Enjoy your money! (Remember to wait a day or two just in case.)
